# Portfolio-Template
Portfolio-template using HTML and inline CSS

This one of my first projects Using HTMl and CSS. I had a great learning experience working on it.
Since it was my first project, I used CSS within the HTML file instead of creating a new file (Inline CSS).

*This is a "Portfolio-Template" hence The information about my skills and project that are displayed on this portfolio website is NOT GENUINE*
